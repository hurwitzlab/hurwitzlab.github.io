            Our lab focuses on large-scale –omics datasets, high-throughput computing, and big data analytics. We leverage these technologies to answer questions related to the relationship between microbes, their hosts, and the environment. In particular, we focus on viral-host interactions and co-evolution given environmental factors (i) in aquatic systems and (ii) for phage treatment of diabetic foot ulcers.
        </p>
        <p>
			Our lab is committed to open science. To this end, we develop bioinformatics tools and support community data resources (via iMicrobe and iVirus). These projects enable large-scale –omics analyses at all levels of computational-ability by using the CyVerse Cyberinfrastructure. To promote community-based learning and protocol sharing in viral ecology we are currently developing VERVENet, a Viral Ecology Research & Virtual Exchange Network in collaboration with protocols.io.

			Our lab was established in August, 2014 at the University of Arizona in the Department of Biosystems Engineering.
